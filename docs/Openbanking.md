# Spendbase Open Banking

Under PSD2 regulations, Spendbase ensures compliance by providing a dedicated interface for open banking, enabling seamless access to account information.

Spendbaseâ€™s focus is on supporting Account Providers by delivering a robust API infrastructure that adheres to open banking standards. While Third Party Providers (TPPs) interact with these APIs to access account data or initiate payments, Spendbase serves as the bridge between Account Providers and TPPs, empowering secure and efficient data sharing.
